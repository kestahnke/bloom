                Welcome to Sprout, an interactive mental health platform! Weâ€™re glad you are here.

            <h2> OUR MISSION</h2>
            <p> 
                Mental health issues have unfortunately been stigmatized in society, and all too often, people are either scared to reach out for help or do not know where to begin. Our goal is to increase exposure to certain resources as well as to help you supplement your own mental health care with our tailored wellness plans. 
            </p>
